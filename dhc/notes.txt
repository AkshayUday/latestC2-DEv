Upgrades to support http to https migration
Usage
  ASSESSMENT
  - Use it alpha order
  - POST is req'd
  - PATCH does changes against the POSTed data
    (The ASSESSMENT PATCH can be used for other types eg. VIDEO etc.,)
  - Subsequent GET fetches results after PATCH induced changes
  - MULTIPLE/SINGLE works
  - bug : Found issues within C1 API. Does not appear to work with array data types
  - PUT is not working (prob needs ifMatch parameter) but no priority given as it returns diff URN. No use for it in C2
  IMAGE
  - Similar setup to ASSESSMENT
  - 
  QUERIES
  - Name describes the query 
  - Paging and return counts are not working. Needs some research.
